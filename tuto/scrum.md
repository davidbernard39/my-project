Scrum : 

- roles
- events
- artifacts
- the rules that bind them together

## Definition of Scrum

Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is:
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

## Scrum theory

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism.

Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: 
- transparency (A common language ; share a common definition of “Done”)
- inspection
- adaptation

Scrum prescribes four formal events for inspection and adaptation, as described in the Scrum Events section of this document:
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective
